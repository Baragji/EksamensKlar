SYSTEM RESTART - AUTONOMOUS CODING AGENTS PROJECT
We're starting completely fresh. The previous attempts have hit too many of the common AI assistant coding problems, and I need a bulletproof approach this time.
YOUR MISSION:

Read ALL existing plans - Review both the "Bulletproof Strategy" and "Master Plan" documents I've shared
Conduct thorough web research - I need you to research the current state of autonomous coding frameworks as of June 2025. No assumptions, only verified facts from the community.
Identify the optimal approach - Find the best method for building autonomous coding agents that can help me build almost anything, focudependency hell
Production-ready, not experimental
Community-proven solutions
June 2025 verified knowledge only


Create the Ultimate Master Plan - Design a complete system that YOU and other AI assistants can actually implement without errors

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
The research I shared shows the top issues developers face with AI coding assistants are:

Context loss (65% of developers)
Quality/reliability problems
Performance issues
Documentation problems
Dependency conflicts

YOUR CHALLENGE:
How will you design a system that avoids these pitfalls? I need you to specifically address:

How will you maintain context across sessions?
How will you ensure reliability and avoid breaking changes?
How will you handle the complexity without creating a mess?

DELIVERABLE:
A complete, actionable master plan that any AI assistant can follow to build a robust autonomous coding system without hitting the common failure modes.
Begin with your research, then present your findings and recommended approach.
